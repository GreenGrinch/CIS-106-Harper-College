// Review Wikipedia: Zeller's congruence. Create a program that asks the user
// for their birthday (year, month, and day)
// and then calculate and display the day of the week on which they were born.
// Use if/else conditional statements to convert the numeric day of the week
// to the correct string representation (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.). Use
// separate subroutines/functions/methods for input, processing, and output.
// Avoid global variables by passing parameters and returning results.
